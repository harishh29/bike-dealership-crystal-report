# BIKE-DEALERSHIP-CRYSTAL-REPORT
## INTRODUCTION
This is a project as introduction to SAP Crystal Report for myself and those who are interested. The process involves from creating a database all the way to report creation.

## TOOLS

The tools involves in this project are:
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Microsoft Excel (If SSMS not connected to Crystal Report as ODBC)

The ERD is first draft using draw.io.

After the database has been created and each table are given their primary key, we can benefit from Database Diagram in SSMS.
