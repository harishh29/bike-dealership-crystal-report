# BIKE-DEALERSHIP-CRYSTAL-REPORT
## INTRODUCTION
This is a project as introduction to SAP Crystal Report for myself and those who are interested. The process involves from creating a database all the way to report creation.

## ERD

The ERD is first draft using draw.io.

After the database has been created and each table are given their primary key, we can benefit from Database Diagram in SSMS.
